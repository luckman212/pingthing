# PingThing

A lightweight menubar app that displays a scrolling graph in your menubar of ICMP latency to a specified target.

Inspired by [Pingr](https://getpingr.app/) which appears to have been abandoned in 2021.

# Settings

Most settings should be self-explanatory. Here is an image of the Settings dialog:

# Bugs? 🐛

There might be bugs! Also, I didn't write the ICMP code—I'm using the [SwiftyPing](https://github.com/samiyr/SwiftyPing) library. Please report [issues](https://github.com/luckman212/pingthing/issues) and I will do my best to address them.
